    <p>
      I am an enthusiastic student who wants to learn programming and gain
      practical experience through an internship. I have always been fascinated
      by how technology can solve real-world problems. I am particularly
      interested in web programming and mobile application development, but I am
      open to learning other programming languages as well. I enjoy working in a
      team and collaborating with other developers to create innovative
      solutions."
